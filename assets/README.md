# Assets Directory

This directory should contain application assets:

- `icon.png` - System tray icon (16x16 or 32x32 recommended)
- `icon.ico` - Windows application icon (for build)

You can create or add your own icons here. For now, the application will work without icons (using empty/placeholder icons).
